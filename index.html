                The first look at Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts is here. On Wednesday,
                <abbr title="Home Box Office">HBO</abbr> Max
                unveiled a still from the upcoming Harry Potter special — premiering on New Year's Day on HBO Max —
                featuring the lead trio of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint sitting in the Gryffindor
                common room. This is the first proper look we have had at Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to
                Hogwarts, following a short tease unveiled over the weekend, attached to the Helen Mirren-hosted
                Harry Potter: Hogwarts Tournament of Houses.
                <br>
                Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts is a reunion that will drop on HBO Max
                on January 1. It will air on TBS and Cartoon Network in Spring 2022, sometime before the April 15
                release date of Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Other cast members taking part in the reunion include Helena Bonham Carter, Robbie Coltrane, Ralph
                Fiennes, Jason Isaacs, Gary Oldman, Imelda Staunton, Tom Felton, James Phelps, Oliver Phelps, Mark
                Williams, Bonnie Wright, Alfred Enoch, Matthew Lewis, Evanna Lynch, and Ian Hart, and more.
                <br>
                According to the press release, the reunion will feature all-new interviews and cast conversations
                celebrating the history of the films, taking place at the original Hogwarts movie sets. The project
                sounds similar to HBO Max's Friends: The Reunion, which brought the sitcom's main cast back together
                to celebrate and reflect on the show and its legacy.

            <h2>‘Squid Game’ Was the Most-Tweeted TV Show of 2021</h2>
            <img class="ph_section" src="./imgs/SquidGame.jpeg" alt="SquidGame">
            <p>
                No shocker here: For Twitter users, it was a green light for “Squid Game,” the massive global hit that
                became Netflix’s biggest TV show in its initial release. The Korean drama was the
                <mark> No. 1 most-tweeted about television show of the year.</mark>
                Twitter released the rankings as part of its year-in-review “#OnlyOnTwitter” report, based on internal
                company data from <del>Jan. 1 - Dec. 1, 2021</del><ins>Jan. 1 - Nov. 15, 2021.</ins>
                <br>
                In the U.S., following “Squid Game” were Disney Plus’ “WandaVision,” “Sesame Street,” “Saturday Night
                Live” and “Game of Thrones,” according to newly released Twitter data.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, on the movie front, “Black Panther” — the 2018 Marvel film starring the late Chadwick Boseman
                — was the most-tweeted about title. Note, however, that includes tweets about “Black Panther: Wakanda
                Forever,” the sequel set for Nov. 11, 2022 release. Warner Bros. took the next three spots with
                “Godzilla vs Kong,” “Zack Snyder’s Justice League” and 2021’s “The Suicide Squad,” followed by
                Sony/Marvel’s “Spider-Man: No Way Home.”

                    Across the globe, people on Twitter strengthened their bonds to their communities in 2021 —
                    including
                    social movements, fandoms, sports teams, and more — proving that connection transcended borders and
                    screens,
                </q>
                - said the social media platform in a post today. Its annual ranking of <em>most-tweeted
                    about, top-liked and most-shared tweets</em> is a bid to get that word out.

            <h2>'The Witcher' Season 2 Clip Shows Ciri Training Like a Warrior</h2>
            <img class="ph_section" src="./imgs/witcher2.jpeg" alt="Witcher">

                With less than a week to The Witcher season 2’s highly anticipated premiere, Netflix (<dfn>Netflix</dfn>
                is a streaming service that offers a wide variety of award-winning TV programmes, films, anime,
                documentaries
                and more – on thousands of internet-connected devices.) has released a clip
                that provides additional insight on what to expect from the show’s sophomore run.
                <br>
                In the newly released clip,<strong>Princess Ciri, played by Freya Allan is seen at Kaer Morhen</strong>
                an old keepwhere Witchers of the School of the Wolf were trained. The scene shows Ciri in training as
                she goes head-to-head with an enormous pendulum. The princess is knocked to the ground several times but
                in an effort of resilience, she is able to defeat her swinging foe.
                <br>
                Speaking with Netflix, Cavill revealed that the focus of his new costume’s design, which he helped
                create along with costume designer Lucinda Wright, allowed him better mobility in more strenuous action
                scenes. He confirmed that fans will get to see the result of their work in all its glory in the third
                episode of Season 2 but that, for the attentive eye, it is possible to notice the costume earlier than
                that.
